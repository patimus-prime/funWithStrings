Acquire text via web scraping, check for palindromes and anagrams on web pages

Intended use:
./launchFinder.sh [URL]

I suggest my dog's website (current deployment as of 22 July 2022): https://maximum-effort-4dpohzbth-patimus-prime.vercel.app/

May need to add permissions to execute this .sh:
sudo chmod a+x ./launchFinder.sh
